This is just a little samba
Built upon a single note
Other notes are sure to follow
But the root is still that note

Now this new note is the consequence of the one we've just been through
As i'm bound to be the unavoidable consequence of you

There's so many people who can talk and talk and talk
And just say nothing or nearly nothing
I have used up all the scale i know and at the end i've come
To nothing i mean nothing

So i come back to my first note as i must come back to you
I will pour into that one note all the love i feel for you
Any one who wants the whole show show do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ci-do
He will find himself with no show better play the note you know
